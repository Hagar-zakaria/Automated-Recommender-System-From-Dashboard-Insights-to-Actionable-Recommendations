# Automated-Recommender-System-From-Dashboard-Insights-to-Actionable-Recommendations

The objective here is to create an automated system that generates personalized recommendations based on specific insights derived from a dashboard (in Power BI, Tableau, Google Colab, etc.). The focus is on leveraging pre-existing insights and triggering actions based on these insights.

# Steps to Build an Automated Recommender System

1. Data Extraction from the Dashboard
Retrieve the latest insights and data from your existing dashboard.

2. Recommendation Logic
Based on the extracted insights, develop logic to generate automated recommendations.

3. Triggering Actions
Automatically send alerts or messages to specific stakeholders based on the recommendations.
